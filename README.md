# MITx: Computational Thinking Using Python Series (6.00.1x & 6.00.2x)

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects and problem sets completed as part of the MITx edX series:

- 6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python
- 6.00.2x: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data

These courses are part of the MITx "Computational Thinking Using Python" series and provide a strong foundation in programming, algorithmic thinking, and data-driven problem solving using Python 3.

## Overview

Each folder in this repository represents a problem set from the series and includes:

- My solution to the coding challenge
- Optional notes summarizing key concepts
- Reflections on what the task taught me

---

## Topics Covered

Across both courses, the following topics are explored:

- Python programming (functions, recursion, OOP)
- Algorithm design and complexity
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
- Simulation and modeling
- Probability and statistics
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Random walks
- Dynamic programming
- Graphs and graph optimization
- Curve fitting and data visualization with pylab
