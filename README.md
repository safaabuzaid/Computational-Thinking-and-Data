# Computational Thinking and Data – 6.00.2x (edX | MITx)

This repository contains my personal solutions and notes from the MITx course "Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data (6.00.2x)", hosted on edX.

The course teaches how to use computation to solve a wide variety of real-world problems and provides a practical introduction to algorithmic thinking, data modeling, and simulations — all implemented in Python 3.

## Course Description

This course is designed for learners with some prior programming experience in Python and basic knowledge of computational complexity. It places a strong emphasis on writing programs to implement concepts and solve problems computationally.

Throughout the course, I’ve worked on problems like:
- Simulating a robot vacuum cleaning a room
- Modeling virus replication and drug treatments in a patient’s body

## Topics Covered

- Advanced programming in Python 3  
- Knapsack problem and optimization  
- Graphs and graph-based algorithms  
- Dynamic programming  
- Plotting with pylab  
- Random walks  
- Probability and distributions  
- Monte Carlo simulations  
- Curve fitting  
- Statistical fallacies
